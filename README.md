## Introduction
An application that renders the users data that comes from different .json files in the order that the jsons are structured and using a javascript
solution that comes from test A application.

Built with React, without any dependencies to manage context such as Redux, due the reason that even knowing that this application
doesnt need any way of handling a global state since is short in terms of size data that handles and logic management, native react context was 
added to increse the product value in the context of sharing knowloge.

## Project Status
Styling - needs to be refined.

Logic - already complete (keys needs to beed added within the map logic to avoid errors).
